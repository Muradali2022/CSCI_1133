# Name: sameKeys
# Purpose: looks for keys that are found in both dictionaries and returns a new dictionary that contains key:value pairs where
# the key in the new dictionary is the key found in both dictionaries, diction1 and diction2, and the new
# keyâ€™s value being a list of the values of diction1.key and diction2.key values concatenated together. 
# Precondition: must enter in two different dictionaries
# Input Parameter(s): diction1 (dictionary), diction2 (dictionary)
# Return Value(s): an empty list or a list of the values of diction1.key and diction2.key values concatenated together
#============================================

#==========================================
# Name: averageGrades
# Purpose: takes in a dictionary with keys representing students and
# values representing their grades and will return a new dictionary with keys representing students
# and values representing an average of their grades
# Precondition: a dictionary must be input
# Input Parameter(s): diction (dictionary)
# Return Value(s): an empty dictionary for zero inputs, a keyword and a 0 for no inputs matching input, or
# will return a new dictionary with keys representing students and values representing an average of their grades.
